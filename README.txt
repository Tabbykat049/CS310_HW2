How HW2 Works:
In our game, there are 2 separate levels. A level one that contains most if not all of the project and where we can teleport from place to place. It has 3 different grabbables(interactables). We also have a gun which contains ammo to begin with and you have to shoot the targets which change color with one shoot and the second shoot destoys them. Once all five tagets have been elimated which are also being tracked you will be transported to out Win level. This level just contains a text saying that you win.
